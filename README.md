BRAINTRIPS
==========
BRainwide Activity Induced by Neuromodulation via TRanscriptomics-Informed Pharmacological Simulation

Dependencies
============
Requires Python 3. [One of the scripts](https://github.com/murraylab/braintrips/blob/main/study/scripts/Generate_Map_Image.py) demonstrates how to save brain map images using 
[wbplot](https://github.com/jbburt/wbplot), and wbplot is NOT (as of Jun 13, 2021) 
compatible with Windows (due to the fact that some functionality in Connectome
Workbench is not currently supported on the Windows operating system). 

Documentation
=============
See the [scripts](https://github.com/murraylab/braintrips/tree/main/study) for a few examples of how to use the modeling code in this package.
